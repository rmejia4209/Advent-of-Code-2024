# Advent of Code 2024
## Overview
This repository contains a collection of scripts I wrote to solve the 
puzzles of the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).
## Motivation
A big thank you to Eric Wastl for creating and sharing this challenge. It
provided me with clear objectives, well-defined milestones, and opportunities
to apply widely-used algorithms and techniques (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, depth-first search, memoization). This experience helped me gain friction to
code daily and strengthened my ability solve complex problems efficiently.
